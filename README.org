My utilities on top of =mv-grid= and =mv-gsll=


=mv-grid+gsll= provides utilities that use the combined facilities of
=mv-grid=, =grid=, and =gsll=.  The utilities improve the user
interface and add traceability to data analysis.


* Facilities

  - Tabular data including look-up and interpolation

* History and future
  =mv-grid= and =mv-gsll= provide utilities on top of Liam Healy's
  =gsd= and =gsll= packages.  These two packages specialize on their
  parent libraries only.

  In the future my utilities will be either submitted to Liam's new
  =Antik= package, or live on top of it or its subsystems.
